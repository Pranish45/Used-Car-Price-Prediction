# Used-Car-Price-Prediction
The automotive industry is witnessing a growing demand for used cars, driven by factors such as economic considerations, increased awareness of environmental impact, and a desire for cost-effective transportation. The fluctuating nature of used car prices poses a challenge for both buyers and sellers in establishing fair and competitive pricing. 
The project is driven from dataset of approximately 10,000 used car collection of car company AUDI. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning-based system for predicting used car prices.
The primary objective of this project is to create an accurate and reliable used car price prediction model using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical data on various car attributes and market trends, the model aims to assist buyers and sellers in making informed decisions regarding pricing and purchasing of used cars.
